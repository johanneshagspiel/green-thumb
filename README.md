## Names and student numbers

### Ardy Zwanenburg
Student number: 4856848
With this project I want to improve my programming skills and my problem solving skills. Also I want to be there for my group if they need help with working in a group. The most important thing I want to learn from this project is how to set up a working server so that multiple people can acces it from different locations.

### Jari van den Broek
Student number: 4932749
I would like to improve my programming skills and to build my first real desktop application, I think learning about how the server and client communicate and how you setup such communication is very valuable.

### Johannes Hagspiel
Student number 4910109

My goal is to learn about server-client communication and about Scrum. Additionally, I want to try to include all the things that I have learned previously like the database and the web technology aspects. My weaknesses are explaining things and my impatience. I hope that I can use what I have previously learned about project management for this project. To learn more about server-client communication and Scrum, I want to volunteer for these parts. These goals are important to me because I think project management skills are valuable and rare. Server-client communication is a key element of modern software and thus being proficient in using it is why I want to learn more about it. Overall, learning more about the various tools and programs used in Java software engineering is what I want to focus on.

### Lukas Zimmerhackl
Student number: 4904176
I want to learn how to work in a group environment, learn to work with git and I want to learn how to create bigger applications

### Nick van Riet
Student number: 4868900
With this project, my main goal is to gain experience with working as a team, including any tools (GitLab, etc.). Furthermore, I also want to further develop my programming skills and broaden my knowledge of existing resources (libraries, software, etc.). To achieve these goals, I will do my best to actively communicate with my team: helping others when I can and asking for help when needed.

### Nathan Ordonez
Student number: 4936205
-- Step 1 -- Two of my strong points are probably my prior experience with Java projects, when I designed a Steganography program as well as worked on a video game, otherwise generally my experience with fiddling around with the terminal, which stems from me trying to install Linux on all my computers as a kid, and trying to make different services such as FTP work on them. Both of these are not examples from a group environment, but one can clearly see the benefit. \
As for my weaker points, I think I will have to strive to become better at communicating my work, asking for help when I need it (which has been a problem during the OOP Assembly project) as well as actively searching for teammates who need help. (same example). This has led to cramming at the latest lab session.
Next, for my core quadrant, I will write it in this form: Core  Quality -- Pitfall -- Challenge -- Allergy
Experience, practice -- underestimating the workload -- work consistently and early on -- untidyness and disorganization

-- Step 2 -- GROW \
G - Goal - To learn proper Git and Maven and to learn how to properly work following the Agile framework. \
R - Reality - I've learned how to work using Sourcetree but I was unable to even clone using the terminal Git. The fact that I completed this deadline shows that I am making progress towards my goals. \
O - Options - One option is to keep doing as I'm doing, which is experimenting on my computer and searching on Google. Another option is to start working with my teammates and asking them for advice.
Both options are of interest to me, and the only thing stopping me is myself.
W - Will - I am going to work harder, study harder, and communicate better, ASAP, and a good first step is to check in with my group to make sure my Development Plan is approved by them. They can help me with their opinions. \
Some concrete steps for attaining my goals are, each week, to plan working time, schedule some of it with my team, and make sure I stick to it.

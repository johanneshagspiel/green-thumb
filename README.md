## Names and student numbers

### Ardy Zwanenburg
Student number: 4856848 ![Ardy Zwanenburg](img/aZwanenburg.jpg)
With this project I want to improve my programming skills and my problem solving skills. Also I want to be there for my group if they need help with working in a group. The most important thing I want to learn from this project is how to set up a working server so that multiple people can acces it from different locations.


### Jari van den Broek
Student number: 4932749
I would like to improve my programming skills and to build my first real desktop application, I think learning about how the server and client communicate and how you setup such communication is very valuable.

![Nick van Riet](img/NickvanRiet.jpg)
With this project, my main goal is to gain experience with working as a team, including any tools (GitLab, etc.). Furthermore, I also want to further develop my programming skills and broaden my knowledge of existing resources (libraries, software, etc.). To achieve these goals, I will do my best to actively communicate with my team: helping others when I can and asking for help when needed.

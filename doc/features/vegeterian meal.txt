per day a vegeterian diet saves about 4 pounds of co2 compared to medium meat eaters
so that would be 1.3 pounds per meal on average?
and thats about .6 kg of CO2 per meal.

medium meat eater 12.4 pound co2 per day = 12.4/3 = 4.13 pounds per meal on average
	and that equals 1.8748 kg of co2 per meal on average

vegetarians 8.4 pounds of co2 per day = 8.4/3 = 2.8 pounds of co2 on average per meal
	and that equals 1.2700 kg of co2 per meal on average

difference between vegetarian and medium meat eaters per meal = 1.8748 - 1.2700 = 0.6047 kg of co2
